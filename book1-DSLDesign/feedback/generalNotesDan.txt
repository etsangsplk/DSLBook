- I like very much that you talk a lot about fundamental aspects of language engineering and not focuse only on implementation like the other books on DSLs. This makes your job as writer also more difficult :-)
- it is not clear to me who is the targeted audience, who should read the book, and what should their benefit be. Most of the CS books are based on already existing things that are merely brought together by the writer; in your book you have a significant amount of new conceptual things (this is due to the fact that language engineering as a field exists since short time). The writing style now is somewhere between scientific papers and practice ... however these are different communities with different interests :-)
- I find that most of the times the formula could be left out since, depending on your audience, they do not contribute to the understanding and intuition about the concepts, and for formal guys the formula are not precise enough
- I like the examples, however they should be more detailed many times showing concrete program fragments with the languages. For example, in Section 1.8.1. on page 60, a piece of code showing how the concerns are implemented would be helpful
- I like the parallel between knowledge organization in domain hierarchies and languages used to express this knowledge. Choosing and commiting to a certain "domain" by defining its borders is a job of language requirements engineering and is a highly social activity (at the end the language users must decide which concepts exactly the language will have and commit to the language)
- The "Core Design Dimensions" chapter is quite dense, abstract and long. I could imagine a completely different organization of the book: one chapter for language extensions, one for referencing, one for embedding, etc In each of these new chapters the discussion and examples and tools will be focused on one of these techniques.
- I somehow have the feeling that you have material for more books :-) -- one is about domain engineering/requirements engineering for languages, the other is about design dimensions
