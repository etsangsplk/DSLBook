This review phase addresses the second part of the book that is essentially a tutorial
on implementing DSLs based on three example tools: Xtext, MPS and Spoofax. 

Regarding contents, the whole part is finished and hopefully complete, except the chapter
on debugging. We haven't managed to finish in time. Also, the topic is quite bleeding
edge, and in two months there will be more interesting stuff to write about.

This part is not yet checked for formulations, typos and layout (specifically the side 
notes may not be at the correct location). Also, some cross-references are still incomplete. 
PLEASE DO NOT REPORT problems regarding typos, layout and cross-references. 

You can find the PDF for review at this URL:

If you want to work on the Latex source, please contact me. Based on the experiences
with the first part of the book I think PDF works better. But I am flexible :-)

The Deadline for the review is August 15, this is two months from now. Please let me
know if you are not going to make it by then. 

Thank you *very* much for helping with the review. I really appreciate it. The first
part of the book has improved a lot based on the review feedback. Please ping me if
you have any questions.
