GENERAL
-------------------------------------------
- use "\emph{..}" for emphasis, not "\textit{..}" 

- similarly "\strong{..}" instead of "\textbf{..}"

- code examples: verbatim, footnotesize
  later: use a style to add highlighting, or do it manually 
  in each code example

- put code inline ("as the code below shows...") or do we want to make each 
  piece of code a figure with a caption, referring to it with \fig?   

- We don't want to use too colorful/entertaining wording such as this
  "A good Lassie alike, language workbenches eat their own dog food:"
     or
  "it's the proverbial penthouse of the meta tower"
  \MB{OK, I'll save that for my blog, then \verb#;-)#}

- \MV \MB \LK are comments written by the respective person. If we want to 
  address a comment to somebody, we write
  \MV{@MB the comment...} (a comment from Markus to Meinte). This way, one
  can easily search for stuff for somebody by prefixing the @ in the search query.

- Whole paragraphs in parentheses make no sense. Either regular text, or footnote.

- Whenever we refer to program constructs, we use \verb#  # stuff. If we use
  to reserved words or names, we use \emph{  }
  \MB{I'd rather use something \emph{semantic} like a keyword command}

- We do not talk to the reader with "you". We use "we" or passive voice.

- user vs. developer vs. programmer vs. end user/end programmer
  DSL user -> the person who writes programs
  DSL developer -> the person who creates DSLs

- don't use double single quotes
  -> "hidden" instead of ``hidden''
  \MB{The double single quote-style is quite ingrained in my psyche and is also the default for TeXclipse.
  \LaTeX apparently doesn't distinguish between them, so what's the compelling reason?}
  \MV{Eelco requested to use the normal ones and I agreed. So that's what we decided to do}
  \MB{TeXclipse setting: TeXclipse > Editor > Smart keys > Enable conversion of quotation marks, uncheck}

- the "Gedankenstrich" is ---, not just 1 in \LaTeX.

- Close abbreviations with dots with "\ " to instruct \LaTeX not to typeset extra space as per a new sentence.


SPECIFIC WORDS
----------------------------------------
- "Web" instead of "web"
- DSL == domain-specific language (with the hyphen/dash)
- "Turing complete/&c." vs. "turing" 
  (Without A. Turing we wouldn't be writing this book, I guess...)
- "general-purpose", i.e. with the hyphen/dash
- use of '; ' vs. ' - '
- "meta model", i.e. with the &nbsp;
- we use language concept (or concept), not meta class
- "cross-references", i.e. with the hyphen/dash
