> . Quote marks: Most (but, oddly, not all) are coming through as straight quotes

> . If you have laid out your book on an A4 or US Letter page, you will need to
> reduce this for publication. Wiley's standard page size, for example, is 187 mm
>  wide x 235 mm high. 

> . You have used color in your book, but this will be lost - in fact, you may have
>  to explicitly remove it - if you are printing your book grayscale. (Obviously this 
> doesn't matter for PDFs.)

> . Cover: if you use a print-on-demand system like CreativeSpace, they will probably 
> offer cover design tools. Otherwise, creating a full-wrap cover required a bit of specialist 
> work. You will need to create back-cover copy also, and a barcode of the ISBN number 
> and suggested price is conventional. I can generate the barcode graphic for you if you 
> need me to, but I'll need the ISBN number for this.
