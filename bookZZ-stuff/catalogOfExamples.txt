Catalog of examples
===================

This document details the (planned) examples in the book and
explains what each example brings to the table _specifically_,
i.e. what makes the example specifically interesting and/or
what features of the platform the example runs in makes this
possible.

Not all examples should/would cover the whole gammut of specific topics
(like scoping, etc.), but across the board they should. In other words:
the examples don't have to be isomorphic in what they illustrate.


Big ones
--------

mobl (Spoofax/SDF/Stratego)
	# Most of mobl (mapping from DSL to target platform) is defined in the mobl DSL,
		instead of in the grammar or interpreter.
	# HTML and CSS embedded in the mobl DSL (with expression language embedded in that again):
		language composition.
	# Reactive environment: build on save.
	(# Also makes it possible to have small, but meaningful examples.)

refrigerators DSL(s set) (Xtext)
	(# [MV] Make sure it is legal to use this example in the book;
		or substitute with something similar and of comparable complexity.)
	# Reactive/interpretive nature of IDE support (plugin).

Modular Embedded Dsl (MED) (MPS)
	(# Work in progress;
		also the subject of the upcoming research project with real-life requirements coming in from actual users.)
	

Pension workbench? (Intentional)
	(# Use generic version, not the specific ones done with Capgemini.)
	# Good example of a real business DSL
		which uses notations which are closely aligned with the (business) domain.
