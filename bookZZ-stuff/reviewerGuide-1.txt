Hello all,

I want to thank you again for signing up for reviewing my DSL book. The review 
will take place in stages, and the first stage has arrived now. The introduction
to the book, as well as the first section (the one on DSL design) are ready
for review. 

The sections are content-complete (modulo what you will suggest :-)), but it is
not yet layout optimized and copy edited. So please ignore typos and language 
errors, they will be fixed later.

At this stage I would love to hear your thoughts on
* whether something important is missing
* whether I have explained things badly, or stuff needs more examples
* or you disagree with a statement I make

If at all possible, please send me your review by January 15, 2012.

There are two ways to do the review:

* you can either read the PDF and comment inline with comments (e.g. using Foxit 
  on Windows) or by sending me your remarks as a text file. The PDFs are at
    http://www.voelter.de/temp/book/book-intro.pdf
    http://www.voelter.de/temp/book/book-design.pdf

* Alternatively you can comment directly into the Latex source. The content
  is hosted in a git repository at github:

      https://github.com/markusvoelter/DSLBook 

  I have created a branch "review" which you can use to add your comments. 
  Please send me your github user name and I will add you to the list of 
  comitters.   
  The relevant parts are in the book0-introduction and book1-DSLDesign
  directories. The content is in the *.ltx files. To add your comments, 
  please go to the doc.tex file, look for the command 

     \newcommand\markus[1]{\mynote{MARKUS}{#1}} 

  and add a similar one for your name:
      
     \newcommand\yourname[1]{\mynote{YOURNAME}{#1}} 
  
  You can then add a comment via \yourname{Here is my comment}.
  
  Please then commit and push --- ideally, we can all see each other's
  comments and don't have to comment on the same thing several times.
  
  Please let me know if I can help with finding your way around the code.
  
  
Thank you once again very much for helping with the review! I really appreciate 
it!!  

Cheers,
Markus
