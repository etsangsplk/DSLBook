As you may know I am writing a book on DSLs, with contributions from Eelco Visser 
and other people from his group. You can find more about the plan at:
  http://dsl-engineering.org/wiki/introduction

I would like to invite you to review the book drafts!

The book will consist of four main parts: introduction, DSL design, DSL 
implementation (Xtext, MPS Spoofax) and DSL use. Each of these parts will be 
finished and ready for review at a different point in time: 

* Introduction and DSL Design (130 pages): 
  Ready for review early November 2011, reviews due by Jan 15 2012
* DSL Implementation (120 pages):
  Ready for review April 2012, reviews due by June 1, 2012
* DSL use (100 pages)
  Ready for review early October 2012, reviews due by Dec 1, 2012
... publication by Feb 1, 2013

There are two ways to perform the review:
* I can send you PDFs. Feedback either as PDF comments or in a text file
* Alternatively I can give you write access to the repository, and you  
  can comment directly into the Latex files. This would actually be preferrable.
