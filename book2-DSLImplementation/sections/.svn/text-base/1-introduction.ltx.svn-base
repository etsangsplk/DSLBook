\section{Introduction}

In this section %%% /chapter?
we describe language implementation with three language workbench tools which
are all Open Source and representative for the current state of the art of
language workbenches. For more example language implementations using more
language workbenches, take a look at the LWC 11 website.

Note that this description are not intended to serve as a tutorial for any
of these tools, but as an illustration of the concepts and ideas involved with
language implementation in general.
