\section{Debugging DSLs}	

debugging the DSL definition (use the debugger of your favourite LWB)
  
debugging the models: only makes sense for models with behavior
state machine debuggers exist
not a lot of support for "getting a debugger for free" from the language definition
problem: debugging on several levels (DSL, intermediate, implemetation), error traceability through the levels
MPS as an example?
