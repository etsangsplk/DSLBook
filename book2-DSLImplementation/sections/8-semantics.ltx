\section{Semantics}		

use BSH SM example as an example of testing the semantics 
  (intp and gen, systematische Tests for Event Handling)
  

explain how this section is more than (systematic) testing.
(see if we can say sth sensible here)

Do we need this here? We have it in the Dimensions paper.

Semantics is "what it all means"
Use statemachines as an example of a notation that may have many semantics (Ptolemy)
Approaches to defining semantics

Translators (denotational semantics)
- Typically used: map to something whose semantics you (think you) know

    Interpreters (operational semantics)
      - interpreters as model of semantics
      - see WebDSL semantics
   
      Reasoning about semantics
      - Problem: How do you know the mapping is correct
        
you define it away: what the mapping does it what it means, by definition!
What do you do if you have several mappings to different targets? 
How do you make sure these do the same thing?
Pragmatics: Textual docs and (high coverage) testing
computational models: temproal data, reactive (mobl)
interpreter + generator must be the same
proofing vs. testing
"Interpreter is easier to understand and reason about"
model checking!
