- I find it super interesting to have both abstract concepts and the way how they are reflected/supported by different workbenches; this makes however the book more difficult to read
- the book is not a tutorial for any of the tools (spoofax, MPS, xtext) and some degree of knowledge about these tools is needed to understand the book
- actually many parts about the use of the tools are quite detailed and hard to follow by non-experts
- I think that you should make explicit how this book should be read by whom (e.g. a beginner should read concepts, etc; an xtext expert should read ...), what are the prerequisites from readers (e.g. play with xtext tutorials for 20 hours) and what should the readers learn from the book (particular tools or rather an unifying and comprehensive view about how are different concepts implemented in the tools)
