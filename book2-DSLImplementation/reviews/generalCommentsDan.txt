- I find it super interesting to have both abstract concepts and the way how they are 
  reflected/supported by different workbenches; this makes however the book more 
  difficult to read
  
-> yes. Some parts are tough. But I didn't want to write another hello-world level
   book. There are enough of these.  
  
- the book is not a tutorial for any of the tools (spoofax, MPS, xtext) and some 
  degree of knowledge about these tools is needed to understand the book
  
-> Well, I was trying to make sure we have enough details in the book to make things
   believable. I don't really know what to do about it. I was hoping that we had enough
   introductory stuff in it for this not to be a problem.  
  
- actually many parts about the use of the tools are quite detailed and hard to 
  follow by non-experts
  
-> hm.... people can always skip ahead about some of these details.  
  
- I think that you should make explicit how this book should be read by whom 
  (e.g. a beginner should read concepts, etc; an xtext expert should read ...), what 
  are the prerequisites from readers (e.g. play with xtext tutorials for 20 hours) 
  and what should the readers learn from the book (particular tools or rather an 
  unifying and comprehensive view about how are different concepts implemented in the 
  tools)
  
-> I have added such a section.
