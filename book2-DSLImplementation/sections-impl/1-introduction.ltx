\noindent This part of the book has been written together Lennart Kats and Guido
Wachsmuth (who have contributed the material on Spoofax) and Christian Dietrich,
who helped with the language modularization in Xtext.

In this part we describe language implementation with three language workbench
tools which are all Open Source and representative for the current state of the
art of language workbenches: Spoofax, Xtext and MPS. For more example language
implementations using more language workbenches, take a look at the Language
Workbench Competition website at \ic{http://languageworkbenches.net}.

Note that this description are not intended to serve as a tutorial for any
of these tools, but as an illustration of the concepts and ideas involved with
language implementation in general.

Each chapter contains examples from all three tools. The ordering of the
tools is different from chapter to chapter based on the characteristics of each
tool: if the example for tool A illustrates a point that is also relevant for
tool B, then A is discussed before B.
